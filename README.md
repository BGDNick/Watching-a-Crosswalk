# Watching-a-Crosswalk
This repository contains the source code for the final project "Watching the Crossroad" at the Intro2CV Skoltech 2022 course. We propose a method for moving car detection at street videos based on classical CV algorithms.

The code is organized in jupyter notebooks:
* 'Compare Algos.ipynb' - implementation of the proposed algorithm
* 'YOLO baseline.ipynb' - YOLO applied to moving car detection
* 'SpeedDetection.ipynb' - speeders detection algorithm

Vids directory contains source video clips obtained from real-world CCTV cameras.
